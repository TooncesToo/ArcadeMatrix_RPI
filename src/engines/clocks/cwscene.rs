//! Shared geometry for the clock faces adapted from the 64x64 "Clockwise" clockfaces.
//!
//! Those faces are drawn for a square panel. Rather than stretch one across a wide sign, the scene
//! is placed in the middle at its own size and a face draws its moving parts at scene coordinates,
//! which keeps the middle 64x64 behaving exactly as the original does. On a panel shorter than the
//! scene the artwork is halved so the whole picture still fits.
//!
//! The same helpers exist in the ESP32 firmware, so both signs lay these faces out identically.
